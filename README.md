This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user. It uses the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset and processes features such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and movie overview to create a combined feature column. With the help of CountVectorizer and Cosine Similarity, the system identifies movies with the closest similarity scores. The project also applies NLP preprocessing techniques like stemming (using NLTK) to normalize text data. A simple and interactive web interface is built using Streamlit, where users can select a movie and instantly get the top 5 recommended titles along with their posters (fetched from the TMDB API). Finally, the app is deployed on Heroku for easy online access.
